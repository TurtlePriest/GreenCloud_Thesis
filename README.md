# Green Cloud Thesis project
*This application is developed by [Eficode](https://github.com/eficode-academy/quotes-flask). I will only make small modifications for testing purposes.*


## Setup
Build both images in frontend and backend manually and name them. Change the names in the main docker-compose file so that the names match. Then run docker compose up. The server will be available at "https://localhost:5000".
